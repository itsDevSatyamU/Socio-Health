Socio health app is an android app which takes user age and the the social platform used by him as an input, with this it also asks the user to input the time spent on that particular social media. As a result, it tells the user whether spending of that much of time for him on a particular social media is good or could be better. In addition it gives a little info of what people generally do in that age based on the age given by user.
